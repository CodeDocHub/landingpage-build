Doclin is a modern way of commenting on codebase. It is built for large software developer teams dealing with complex systems.

# With doclin,

1. **You don't need to leave your IDE to ask a question on a piece of code**.\
If you come across a code that raises questions, simply tag your teammember on doclin and ask the question. Your question and answer you received will stay coupled with the code which anyone can view at any time.

2. **You no longer need inline comments**.\
Inline comments are messy and gets easily outdated. They are often redundant where explanation is not necessary and often not useful when explaning difficult business logic. You can use doclin's rich text editor and thread-reply system that everyone loves to leave comments on your code.

3. **You  will not waste time on problems that have been solved before**. \
Any questions asked on particular piece of code stays coupled to the code in doclin. So whenever you pull up a tangly source code you may already come across threads that answers your question.

4. **You can prevent unclean code from reoccuring in the future**.\
If you ever come across some unclean code your colleagues have written and if you want future devs to not copy-paste these? Simple leave a comment on that, suggest a better alternative and you are good to go!


# Doclin is super easy to set up

1. Install the extension in VS Code.
2. Open a folder or a file where you want to leave a comment. To get the most out of doclin's productivity, use a git repo.
3. Open doclin extension from the left activity bar.
4. If you are using doclin for the first time, you will be asked to create an organization and project. This will create a .doclin file in your directory - push it to git and all your teammates will be able to collaborate with you on doclin.
5. You are ready to use doclin!
